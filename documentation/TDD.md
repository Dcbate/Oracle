# 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guide

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. This process helps ensure that the code meets its requirements and promotes a design-driven approach.

## 🎯 Key Steps in TDD

1. **Write a test**: Write a test for a specific function or feature that doesn’t exist yet.
2. **Run the test and see it fail**: Since the feature hasn’t been implemented, the test should fail.
3. **Write the minimum amount of code**: Implement the simplest code that will make the test pass.
4. **Run the test and see it pass**: Ensure the test now passes with the new implementation.
5. **Refactor the code**: Clean up the code while keeping the test passing.
6. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature.

## 🛠️ Benefits of TDD

- **Better code quality**: Forces developers to think about use cases and edge cases.
- **Fewer bugs**: Tests are created as features are implemented.
- **Design improvement**: Writing tests first encourages simple, flexible designs.
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Most code has associated tests.

## 📋 Example: TDD with Java

Let’s walk through an example of using TDD to build a simple function that checks if a number is even.

### 1. Write the Test

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class NumberUtilsTest {
    @Test
    public void testIsEven() {
        assertTrue(NumberUtils.isEven(2));
        assertFalse(NumberUtils.isEven(3));
    }
}
```

### 2. Run the Test and See it Fail

At this point, the `isEven` method does not exist, so the test will fail.

### 3. Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test

```java
public class NumberUtils {
    public static boolean isEven(int number) {
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

### 4. Run the Test and See it Pass

When you rerun the test, it will now pass because the method implementation satisfies the test cases.

### 5. Refactor

There might not be any need to refactor here since the code is already simple and correct. However, you can always revisit the code later as new requirements arise.

## 🚀 TDD in Practice

TDD fits well with **Agile** and **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** practices. You can ensure that features are built iteratively and are always fully tested before deployment.

### Common Tools for TDD in Java:

- **JUnit**: The most popular testing framework in Java.
- **Mockito**: A mocking framework for unit tests.
- **AssertJ**: A rich assertions library for fluent assertion style.

## 🤔 Common Challenges with TDD

- **Takes time**: Writing tests first can slow initial development, but it saves time in the long run by reducing bugs.
- **Over-testing**: Not every piece of code needs a test. Focus on critical functionality.
- **Hard to adopt**: TDD can be difficult for teams used to traditional development processes, but training and practice help.

## 👨‍💻 Example of TDD Workflow

Here’s a quick summary of how you might proceed in a TDD workflow:

1. Write a failing test for a feature.
2. Implement the feature.
3. Ensure all tests pass.
4. Refactor as needed.
5. Commit the code to version control.

TDD promotes building **clean, testable**, and **well-architected code**. It's a powerful approach for ensuring your software is reliable and your codebase remains flexible and maintainable.
