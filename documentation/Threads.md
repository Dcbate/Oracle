# üåü Java Threads: A Comprehensive Guide üåü

In Java, **threads** are a crucial concept for creating concurrent applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Java provides built-in support for threads through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.util.concurrent` package. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know!

## üí° What is a Thread?

A **thread** is a lightweight process, the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a program can have multiple threads running concurrently, allowing it to perform several tasks at once (also known as **multithreading**). Each thread runs independently and can be controlled individually.

### Why Use Threads?
- üåê **Parallelism**: Perform tasks concurrently, making efficient use of CPU resources.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Better Performance**: Ideal for IO-bound and CPU-bound tasks.
- üé¢ **Smooth User Experience**: In GUI applications, threads can handle background tasks without freezing the UI.

## üîß Creating Threads in Java

Java provides two main ways to create threads:

1. **Extending the `Thread` class**.
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Task to be performed
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

In the first approach, you extend the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method to define the task that the thread will execute. The second approach is more flexible; it involves creating a class that implements the `Runnable` interface, and the task logic is placed inside the `run()` method. A `Thread` object is then created and started.

In both cases, you call the `start()` method to begin thread execution, which in turn invokes the `run()` method of the class.

## üö¶ Thread States

A thread in Java can have several states during its lifecycle:

1. **NEW**: The thread is created but not yet started.
2. **RUNNABLE**: The thread is executing.
3. **BLOCKED**: The thread is waiting to acquire a lock.
4. **WAITING**: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform a specific action.
5. **TIMED_WAITING**: The thread is waiting for another thread for a specified amount of time.
6. **TERMINATED**: The thread has finished execution.

## üïπÔ∏è Managing Threads

Java offers several methods for managing thread behavior:

- `sleep(long millis)` pauses the thread for a given period, allowing other threads to run.
- `join()` allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
- `yield()` gives a hint to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to pause its execution in favor of another thread.
- `interrupt()` signals a thread to stop its current task.


```java 
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted");
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();
        thread.join(); // Main thread waits for this thread to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread ends");
    }
}
```

## üîÄ Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources, there's a chance of conflicting operations. **Thread synchronization** ensures that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing inconsistencies.

### Synchronized Methods or Blocks

You can synchronize entire methods or specific code blocks to ensure exclusive access to shared resources. This prevents race conditions, where multiple threads try to modify the same data at the same time, leading to inconsistent results.


```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    Counter counter;

    MyThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(counter);
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(counter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount()); // Expected 2000
    }
}
```

## üöÄ The `java.util.concurrent` Package

For advanced thread management, Java provides high-level utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package, which include:

- **ExecutorService**: A framework that manages a pool of threads and executes tasks asynchronously.
- **Callable**: Similar to `Runnable` but can return results and throw exceptions.
- **Locks**: More sophisticated locking mechanisms like `ReentrantLock`, offering greater flexibility than synchronized blocks.

By using `ExecutorService`, developers can manage large numbers of threads more efficiently without manually creating and managing each thread.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown(); // Stop accepting new tasks
    }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

1. **Deadlock**: This occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release locks on resources.
2. **Race Condition**: A situation where the result of a program depends on the unpredictable timing of multiple threads executing, often leading to incorrect outcomes.
3. **Starvation**: A situation where a thread never gets CPU time because other threads dominate the processor.

## üìö Conclusion

Java threads are a powerful tool for creating concurrent applications, but they come with complexities like synchronization and potential pitfalls. Using higher-level abstractions from the `java.util.concurrent` package can simplify thread management and reduce errors.
