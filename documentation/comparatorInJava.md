# Comparator and Comparable Interfaces in Java

In Java, `Comparator` and `Comparable` are two interfaces used for sorting collections or arrays of objects. They allow for custom ordering of objects and are often used in conjunction with collections like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.

## 1. `Comparable` Interface

The `Comparable` interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects. When a class implements `Comparable`, it overrides the `compareTo` method, providing a single way of comparing two instances.

### Syntax

```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
    int compareTo(T o);
}
```

### Implementation

A class implementing `Comparable` must override the `compareTo` method to specify its natural ordering. This method returns:
- A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.
- Zero if the current object is equal to the specified object.
- A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.

### Example

Let's consider a `Student` class that implements `Comparable<Student>` based on the student's ID.

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id); // Natural ordering by ID
    }

    // Getters, toString, etc.
}
```

In this example, `Student` objects will be sorted by their IDs when used in a sorted collection like `TreeSet` or when sorted with `Collections.sort()`.

### Usage

```java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student(2, "Alice"));
students.add(new Student(1, "Bob"));
students.add(new Student(3, "Charlie"));

Collections.sort(students);
```

## 2. `Comparator` Interface

The `Comparator` interface is used for custom ordering of objects. It allows us to define multiple ways of comparing objects without altering the class itself.

### Syntax

```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
```

### Implementation

`Comparator` requires the implementation of the `compare` method, which takes two objects and returns:
- A negative integer if the first object is less than the second.
- Zero if the objects are equal.
- A positive integer if the first object is greater than the second.

### Example

Suppose we want to sort `Student` objects by name instead of ID. We can create a custom comparator:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class StudentNameComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return s1.getName().compareTo(s2.getName());
    }
}
```

### Usage

```java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student(2, "Alice"));
students.add(new Student(1, "Bob"));
students.add(new Student(3, "Charlie"));

Collections.sort(students, new StudentNameComparator());
```

## 3. Key Differences Between `Comparable` and `Comparator`

| Feature       | `Comparable`                      | `Comparator`                            |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Package       | `java.lang`                       | `java.util`                             |
| Method        | `compareTo(Object o)`             | `compare(Object o1, Object o2)`         |
| Sorting Order | Defines natural ordering          | Allows multiple sorting orders          |
| Modification  | Requires modifying the class      | No modification needed on the class     |
| Usage         | Single sorting order              | Multiple sorting orders for flexibility |

## 4. Common Usage Examples

### Sorting with Lambda Expressions

With Java 8, `Comparator` became easier to use with lambda expressions:

```java
students.sort((s1, s2) -> s1.getName().compareTo(s2.getName()));
```

### Using `Comparator.comparing`

Java 8 introduced `Comparator.comparing` for more readable and fluent comparisons:

```java
students.sort(Comparator.comparing(Student::getName));
```

### Sorting by Multiple Criteria

We can chain comparators to sort by multiple fields:

```java
students.sort(Comparator.comparing(Student::getName).thenComparing(Student::getId));
```

## 5. Summary

- **Comparable**: Used for natural ordering and requires modifying the class.
- **Comparator**: Provides flexibility for multiple custom ordering without modifying the class.

By understanding both interfaces, you can implement efficient and flexible sorting in Java.
