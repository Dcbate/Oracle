# Database Transactions 📊

Database transactions are a crucial part of database management systems (DBMS) for ensuring data consistency and integrity. They enable a series of operations to be executed as a single unit, with the assurance that all or none of them will complete successfully.

## 📖 What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more database operations (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) that must either all succeed or all fail together. Transactions are especially important in systems where data consistency is critical, such as banking, e-commerce, and enterprise applications.

## 🧩 ACID Properties of Transactions

Transactions are designed to adhere to the **ACID properties**:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations within a transaction are completed; if one fails, the entire transaction fails, and changes are rolled back.
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction. All rules and constraints are upheld.
- **Isolation**: Transactions operate independently of one another, preventing interference and data inconsistencies when multiple transactions run concurrently.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and will persist even in the event of a system crash.

## 🔄 Transaction Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a transaction includes several stages:

1. **Begin**: The transaction starts.
2. **Execute**: The DBMS executes each operation in the transaction.
3. **Commit or Rollback**:
    - **Commit**: If all operations succeed, the transaction is committed, making all changes permanent.
    - **Rollback**: If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back, undoing all changes and preserving data integrity.

## 🔒 Isolation Levels and Concurrency Control

The isolation level defines how a transaction is isolated from other transactions, balancing **data consistency** with **performance**. The main isolation levels are:

1. **Read Uncommitted**: Allows reading uncommitted changes from other transactions, potentially leading to *dirty reads*.
2. **Read Committed**: Only allows reading committed changes, preventing dirty reads.
3. **Repeatable Read**: Ensures repeated reads within the same transaction return the same result, preventing non-repeatable reads.
4. **Serializable**: The highest level, providing full isolation by locking rows/tables, preventing phantom reads and guaranteeing full consistency (with potential performance impacts).

### Common Concurrency Issues

- **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction.
- **Non-repeatable Read**: Data changes between reads within a transaction due to another transaction’s modification.
- **Phantom Read**: New rows appear in subsequent reads within a transaction due to inserts by other transactions.

## ⚙️ Types of Transactions

1. **Single-Statement Transaction**: A single SQL operation that’s implicitly atomic.
2. **Multi-Statement Transaction**: Multiple SQL statements executed together with explicit `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
3. **Distributed Transaction**: Spans multiple databases or resources and often uses a **two-phase commit protocol** to ensure atomicity across systems.

## 📝 Transaction Implementation in SQL

Here’s an example of transaction implementation in SQL:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Perform multiple operations
INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (1, 100);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 10 WHERE id = 1;

-- Commit changes if successful
COMMIT;
```

If an error occurs during the transaction, a rollback can be triggered to revert changes:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Attempt operations
-- If any operation fails, roll back the transaction
ROLLBACK;
```

## 🌟 Benefits of Using Transactions

Transactions help ensure data consistency, accuracy, and reliability by:
- Guaranteeing that all operations in a group succeed or fail together.
- Protecting against partial updates and inconsistent states.
- Supporting complex operations across multiple records or tables.
- Enabling applications to maintain stable and accurate data even in concurrent environments.

## 🚀 Summary

Transactions are an essential part of DBMS that ensure data integrity through the ACID properties, provide control over concurrency, and support a variety of isolation levels and rollback mechanisms to handle failures. They are crucial for applications that require accurate and consistent data management.
